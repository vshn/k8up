= How to Create a Backup

The `Backup` object defines what and how to backup:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$tutorial/backup.yaml[]
----

Save the YAML above in a file named `backup.yaml` and use the `kubectl apply -f backup.yaml` command to deploy this configuration to your cluster.

TIP: To have backups run automatically at a regular interval look at xref:how-tos/schedules.adoc[schedules].
